# MetropolisFPLab Project for Circuit de Catalunya üèéÔ∏è

This project is part of the MetropolisFPLab initiative, a project of innovation promoted by the Metropolitan Agency of Economic Development of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, with the aim of evaluating the talent of vocational training students, bringing them closer to the labor market, fostering the acquisition of key competencies and their employability, all through the methodology of open innovation in a real environment.

The challenge proposed by Circuit de Catalunya is to create a web application that allows them to manage their reservations of the spaces of the circuit. Circuit de Catalunya is a racetrack located in Montmel√≥, which hosts the Formula 1 Spanish Grand Prix, the MotoGP Catalan Grand Prix and other international championships .

## Technologies used üíª

We have used Laravel, a PHP framework, to develop the web application. Laravel is a web framework that provides a robust set of tools and components for building modern web applications. Some of its features are:

- MVC architecture
- Routing system
- Database abstraction layer
- Authentication and authorization
- Blade templating engine
- Artisan command-line interface
- Eloquent ORM
- Testing tools
